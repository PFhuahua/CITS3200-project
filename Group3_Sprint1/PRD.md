# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Academic Document Discovery & Retrieval System

## 1. Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
Academic researchers face time-consuming manual processes to locate historical government publications (particularly census documents) scattered across thousands of libraries and databases worldwide. The client currently does this work manually, spending significant time searching across multiple platforms and coordinating document retrieval from various libraries globally.

### Proposed Solution
An AI-powered web search tool that automatically searches across global libraries, statistical bureaus, and academic databases to locate government census publications. The system will provide comprehensive metadata extraction, prioritized access recommendations (downloadable PDF > remote request > physical retrieval), and organize results by accessibility and location.

### Success Metrics
- Successfully locate 90%+ of queried government publications  
- Reduce document discovery time from manual hours to automated minutes per search
- Provide accurate metadata extraction for discovered documents
- Classify access methods and prioritize by ease of retrieval
- Handle thousands of search queries for the client's research needs

### Resource Requirements
- Development team for 8.5 weeks remaining in semester
- GPT-5 Deep Research access ($200/month budget approved by client)
- Local deployment infrastructure 
- NDA compliance for sensitive document handling
