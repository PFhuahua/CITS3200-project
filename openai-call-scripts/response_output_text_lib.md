**Ireland (1851 Census):** The official *Census of Ireland for the year 1851* (compiled by the Irish Census Office and reported to Parliament) is available online from major research libraries. For example, the Library of Congress provides access to scanned volumes of this report ([www.loc.gov](https://www.loc.gov/item/08018878/#:~:text=Title)). (See especially Part III, 1851, which the LOC has digitized; scroll the item or use the “PDF” link on the LOC page.) Additional volumes (e.g. Parts I and II by province) are likewise documented in library catalogs (see Joseph Masterson’s *1851/1841 Census Abstracts* ([catalogue.nli.ie](https://catalogue.nli.ie/Record/vtls000182413#:~:text=1851%20Census%20of%20Ireland%2C%20Dublin,Chart%2C%20D.A))). These constitute the complete published census returns for Ireland in 1851.
