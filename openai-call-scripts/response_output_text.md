# Nigeria (2000–2020)

- **2006 Population and Housing Census:** The last official census was conducted in 2006 by Nigeria’s National Population Commission ([datacatalog.ihsn.org](https://datacatalog.ihsn.org/catalog/3340/related-materials#:~:text=Producer)).  Detailed results (age/sex distribution by state and LGA) were published as “Priority Tables” (Volumes I–VIII).  For example, *Priority Table Vol. I* (population by age/sex at the state level) and *Vol. II* (LGA‐level housing/amenities) are available as PDFs.  These can be downloaded from the IHSN data portal: [Vol. I (PDF)](https://datacatalog.ihsn.org/catalog/3340/download/48519) ([datacatalog.ihsn.org](https://datacatalog.ihsn.org/catalog/3340/related-materials#:~:text=Priority%20Tables%20Volume%20I)) and [Vol. II (PDF)](https://datacatalog.ihsn.org/catalog/3340/download/48520) ([datacatalog.ihsn.org](https://datacatalog.ihsn.org/catalog/3340/related-materials#:~:text=Priority%20Tables%20Volume%20II%20)).  (Additional volumes III–VIII cover other breakdowns and are similarly available via the IHSN portal.)  

- **Other population data (2000–2020):**  In absence of a new census after 2006, population estimates come from projections and surveys.  For instance, the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics has published population projections (e.g. “Population (2006–2016)” tables) and surveys like the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) provide population counts by region.  However, the primary *census* figures remain those 2006 tables above.  (No full national census was completed between 2010–2020.)  

**Sources:** Official 2006 census data are documented by the National Population Commission ([datacatalog.ihsn.org](https://datacatalog.ihsn.org/catalog/3340/related-materials#:~:text=Producer)), and the priority tables (Volumes I–VIII) can be accessed as PDF files via the IHSN data catalogue ([datacatalog.ihsn.org](https://datacatalog.ihsn.org/catalog/3340/related-materials#:~:text=Priority%20Tables%20Volume%20I)) ([datacatalog.ihsn.org](https://datacatalog.ihsn.org/catalog/3340/related-materials#:~:text=Priority%20Tables%20Volume%20II%20)).
