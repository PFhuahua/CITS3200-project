*Documentation Identification Software/Al Agent*

Human mobility is key to poverty reduction and shared global prosperity. With the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the international community recognized the contribution that migration makes to global welfare. The Agenda's guiding principle, "Leave no one behind," is a call to ensure that marginalized populations remain at the forefront of sustainable development efforts. The Sustainable Development Goals therefore include targets relevant for both international and domestic migration, and emphasize the importance of well-managed migration policies and urban planning efforts. A government's ability to plan and implement responsible migration policies hinges upon access to accurate data and robust modelling. Existing databases of regional populations and internal and international migration flows do not fill this need, as they are coarse-grained and limited in their geographical and temporal coverage. These limitations further prevent analyses of climate-induced demographic change, particularly in less-developed parts of the globe. Despite the current sense of urgency, we know not how many climate-induced migrants will move, where they will move to, nor when. Dr Parsons, working since 2022, has been diligently collating the universe of relevant primary census documents in order to meet these challenges head-on. Once assembled these data will constitute nothing short of a paradigm shift in mankind's understanding of human mobility and most pertinently, will facilitate the first meaningful analyses of the links between climate change and human mobility, not least since our data should feed directly into the ICCP modelling. A team is being sought to develop software/an Al agent, to be able to systematically locate: primary census documents currently omitted from our collection (from a range of inputs), methodically store the files found (in a range of formats), identify the physical location of the documents scattered across libraries worldwide and to collate metadata pertaining to them, such that those documents can be readily obtained in the near future should they not be directly accessible. This task is of paramount importance to the overarching project's success.
